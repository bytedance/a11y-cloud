## Demo Video

## Running the Project

```
yarn start
```

## Complete Project Running Effect

```
yarn build
```

For the convenience of demonstration, this project has customized the build script, which will also run the build command for the a11y-nodejs-server.
Since the server build process is relatively slow, you need to refresh the page to see the effects.
